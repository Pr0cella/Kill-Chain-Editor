## [2.9.2] - 2026-04-30

### Added 
- Small HTML Docstring with project info

### Changed
- **CSV Formula Injection Mitigation**: Cells starting with formula characters are now prefixed with a tab character (\t) and wrapped in double quotes instead of just the single quote prefix that was used previously

## [2.9.1] - 2026-02-28

### Added
- **Function index generator**: Added `scripts/generate-function-index.py` to auto-generate `docs/FUNCTION_INDEX.generated.md` from runtime source function declarations.
- **Generated function inventory**: Added `docs/FUNCTION_INDEX.generated.md` as a machine-generated reference for maintainers.

### Changed
- **Updated Documentation**: `DOCUMENTATION.md` has been simplified & updated to v2.9.0.
- **Documentation cross-linking**: Added references to curated and generated function indexes in `README.md` and `DOCUMENTATION.md`.
- **Release regeneration workflow**: `scripts/regenerate-release.sh` now regenerates `docs/FUNCTION_INDEX.generated.md` before rebuilding `release/` artifacts.

## [2.9.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added
- **STIX Composer**: New STIX 2.1 editor interface for creating & sharing STIX 2.1 objects and bundles. Uses interactive JSON validator reporting to inspect and resolve Object <-> STIX specification mismatches.
- **STIX Visualizer**: Composer-Integrated optional STIX visualizer module
- **Visualizer kill-switch config**: Added `CONFIG.visualizer.enabled` to fully disable STIX visualizer loading/execution paths.
- **Mitigation Relationships**: Mitigation column added to the relationship view, sourced from techniques in each chain.
- **Phase Details Modal**: New modal for phase rollups (click phase in relationship view or use the Phase Details button on phase headers). Designed as high level phase overview for contained items, attached metadata & CVEs, related mitigations and average severity/confidence scores.
- **CSV Technique Import**: Paste technique IDs via CSV or newline into a modal to replace the ATT&CK library; includes a Reset ATT&CK action to restore base data.
- **Global Search**: Expanded global search panel with ranked mixed-type results (ATT&CK/CAPEC/CWE), Sticky mode, and drag-and-drop from results.
- **CSV ID Search**: Comma-separated ID search for ATT&CK, CAPEC, and CWE (supports numeric-only CAPEC/CWE entries).
- **Local iframe IPC bridge (local-mode only)**: Parent/iframe communication path between `index.html`, `explorer.html`, and `stix-builder.html` for theme sync and shared data handoff.
- **IPC debug controls**: Added `CONFIG.debugging.traceLocalIframeIPCLogs` and `CONFIG.debugging.localIframeIPCRateLimit` for traceability and request throttling.
- **IPC API docs**: Added dedicated short technical documentation in `IPC_API-DOCS.md`.

### Changed
**UI Improvements**: Redesigned Navigation & other UI Elements, consolidated all Theme toggles into one
- Phase item Explore/Edit actions now reveal on hover like Delete.
- **Resource loading behavior (visualizer disabled mode)**: STIX Composer and standalone STIX visualizer now avoid loading visualizer-owned and bundled third-party resources when `CONFIG.visualizer.enabled` is `false`.

### Security
- **Iframe containment**: Embedded explorer/composer iframes now use sandbox containment (`allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-modals`).
- **Prototype pollution hardening**: Import parsing/sanitization now blocks dangerous keys (`__proto__`, `constructor`, `prototype`), uses safe JSON reviver parsing, null-prototype object collectors, and own-property checks in dynamic import field mapping.

#### Shared Loader Hardening
- **Pre-cache schema enforcement**: Parent shared dataset now validates required top-level shape before writing to `cache.data`.
- **Size/count guardrails**: Shared dataset now enforces per-bucket entry limits and serialized size limits before cache write.
- **IPC parity on limits**: `AF_SHARED_DATA` payload building now enforces the same shared-data limits at send-time, not only at ingest-time.
- **Immutable loader snapshots**: `window.getAttackFlowSharedData()` now returns validated clone+freeze snapshots instead of exposing mutable cache references.
- **Explorer fallback diagnostics**: Direct parent shared-loader errors/invalid payloads now emit debug trace diagnostics and safely fall back to alternate data sources.

#### Local IPC Hardening
- **Source pinning**: IPC messages are accepted only from expected frame windows.
- **Strict schema enforcement**: IPC message types and keys are allowlisted; unknown keys/types are rejected and traced.
- **Immutable shared payload**: `AF_SHARED_DATA` is shape-validated, cloned, and deep-frozen before IPC send/use.
- **Rate limiting**: Token-bucket throttling (configurable) for incoming IPC requests per frame and request type.
- **Data loading behavior**: Explorer can consume validated shared data from parent in local iframe mode to reduce redundant fetch/load paths.
- **IPC transport hardening**: Channel-only `MessageChannel` transport with session nonce binding; legacy window request/response fallback path removed.
- **Bootstrap resilience**: Parent channel bootstrap now uses bounded timeout/retry/backoff; explorer and stix-builder expose explicit terminal bootstrap-failure recovery behavior without legacy transport.


## [2.8.0] - 2026-02-14

### Added
- **Mitigation CSV Export**: Mitigations linked to assigned ATT&CK techniques now appear as separate rows in CSV exports with `Type: "Mitigation"`. Phase coverage is inherited from linked techniques. Comments column lists the technique IDs each mitigation covers for traceability. Mitigations are deduplicated — shared mitigations appear once regardless of how many techniques reference them.
- **Technique & Mitigation STIX Export**: STIX bundle export now includes assigned ATT&CK techniques as `attack-pattern` SDOs with deterministic UUIDv5 IDs, `external_references` (MITRE source), and `kill_chain_phases` (UKC phase mapping). Mitigations from assigned techniques are emitted as `course-of-action` SDOs with `mitigates` relationship SROs linking to the correct `attack-pattern`. Techniques assigned to multiple phases aggregate all phases. Export now works with any assigned techniques, not just custom STIX objects.
- **Clear STIX Data**: New "Clear STIX Data" button in the STIX sidebar tab removes all STIX items from the library and from all kill chain phase assignments, with a confirmation prompt showing the item count.
- **Auto-Clear STIX on Import**: Two config flags in `CONFIG.imports` control whether existing STIX data is automatically cleared before importing: `clearStixOnBundleImport` (before STIX bundle import) and `clearStixOnKillChainImport` (before kill chain import). Both default to `false`.
- **Collapsible Inline Comments & Descriptions**: Phase item cards in the kill chain now show a collapsible text area below the entity name (non-compact mode only). ATT&CK/CAPEC/CWE cards display metadata comments; STIX/custom cards display the item description. Chevron SVG toggle with smooth CSS height transition. Area is vertically resizable. Global "Comments" toolbar button toggles all collapsibles at once. Hidden automatically in compact mode.

## [2.7.1] - 2026-02-14

### Added
- **Technique Cross-Reference Badges**: Markdown-style links to other ATT&CK techniques in entity descriptions (543 occurrences) are now rendered as styled inline ID badges. Clicking a badge opens the integrated Relationship Explorer for that technique. Applies to both description and detection sections.

### Fixed
- **Reference link hardening (ATT&CK detail panel & Relationship Explorer)**: attribute-safe escaping and strict `http`/`https` validation for reference URLs.

## [2.7.0] - 2026-02-09

- **Kill Chain Description**: Collapsible description textarea between the title bar and statistics bar. Collapsed by default with a subtle preview hint (truncated text or "none"). Smooth CSS transition with chevron SVG toggle. Supports up to 2,000 characters (configurable via `CONFIG.display.maxKillChainDescLength`). Included in JSON import/export — missing `description` field defaults to empty string for backward compatibility.
- **Clear Confirmation**: `clearAssignments()` now shows a `confirm()` dialog before wiping all assignments.
- **Collapsible Descriptions**: ATT&CK, CAPEC, and CWE entity descriptions in the detail modal are now wrapped in `<details>/<summary>` elements, collapsed by default. ATT&CK detection guidance is also collapsible.
- **Metadata at Top**: For ATT&CK/CAPEC/CWE entities, the metadata summary (score, confidence, phase, CVEs, comments, hyperlinks, observables) now appears above the entity detail in the modal dialog.
- **STIX Bundle Import**: New "Import STIX Bundle" button in the STIX sidebar tab — parse any STIX 2.1 bundle JSON and extract all supported SDOs into the STIX item library.
  - Supports all 18 SDO types plus `x-custom`: attack-pattern, campaign, course-of-action, grouping, identity, indicator, infrastructure, intrusion-set, location, malware, malware-analysis, note, observed-data, opinion, report, threat-actor, tool, vulnerability.
  - Relationships, sightings, and marking-definitions are silently skipped.
  - Full spec-defined property import using `STIX_OBJECTS` type definitions from `stix-config.js` (e.g., `threat_actor_types`, `aliases`, `goals`, `pattern`, `malware_types`).
  - Duplicate detection: objects already in the library (by STIX ID) are skipped with a count.
  - Toast summary reports imported, duplicate, and invalid counts.
- **STIX Property Import on Kill Chain Import**: `sanitizeImportedData()` now preserves all STIX spec-defined fields from `customLibrary` entries (previously only core fields were kept).
- **Edit STIX Properties**: Full STIX editor modal now reads and writes all spec-defined fields for each SDO type (required + optional), using appropriate controls per field type.
- **STIX Property Display**: Entity detail modal (`openEntityModal`) shows all populated STIX spec fields for custom items via `buildStixPropertySummary()`.
- **Closable Loading Overlay**: When data fails to load (e.g., opening via `file://` protocol), the loading screen shows a "Continue Without Data" button and hint text so users can still import Navigator layers, create STIX objects, and import saved kill chains.
- **`stix-config.js`**: Comprehensive STIX 2.1 configuration with all 19 SDO type definitions, field descriptors (type, label, vocabulary, required/optional), vocabulary lists, relationship defaults, and helper functions.
- **`examples/stix-demo.json`**: Full showcase kill chain ("Operation Midnight Eclipse") with all 19 STIX object types, realistic field values, distributed across UKC phases.
- **`examples/Operation-Midnight-Eclipse-stix-bundle.json`**: Exported STIX 2.1 bundle of the stix-demo scenario (25 SDOs + 18 relationships) for bundle import testing.

### Changed
- Sidebar tab renamed from "Custom" to **STIX** throughout the UI.
- Layer toggle checkbox renamed from "Custom" to **STIX**.
- Create button renamed from "+ Create Custom Item" to **+ Create STIX Item**.
- Search placeholder updated to **Search STIX items...**.
- `TYPE_LABELS.custom` changed from `'Custom'` to `'STIX'`.
- Footer legend includes **STIX Object** entry with teal color swatch.
- Kill chain title now uses flexbox layout instead of absolute positioning for responsive behavior — no longer overlaps sidebar toggle or view controls on narrow viewports.
- Kill chain title input width scales with available space (`flex: 1`) up to 700px max, with ellipsis on overflow.
- Compact mode no longer shrinks the title input.
- Usage guide modal updated with STIX sections.

### Fixed
- **STIX ID mangling**: `sanitizeAttr()` was stripping `--` from STIX IDs in sidebar detail panel, tag rendering, delete buttons, and compact tooltips. Replaced with `esc()`/`encodeHtmlEntities()`.
- **Modal nesting**: Create Custom Item modal was erroneously nested inside the Metadata Editor overlay with `visibility: hidden`. Moved to be a sibling.
- **Spaces bug**: Global `input` event listener ran `sanitizeUserInputText()` → `normalize()` → `.trim()` on every keystroke, removing spaces mid-typing. Added exemption for Create and Edit STIX modal inputs.
- **Drag copy-instead-of-move**: STIX items were copied instead of moved when dragged between phases because `extractAssignmentInstance`, `findAssignment`, and `updateAssignmentMetadata` hardcoded type-to-key mappings without `custom` → `customItems`. Switched all three to use `TYPE_KEYS[type]`.
- **Long STIX ID overflow**: STIX IDs caused horizontal scroll in phases. Changed all 4 tag types from `inline-flex` to `flex` with `min-width: 0`, added ellipsis on `.id` spans, `flex-shrink: 0` on `.tag-actions` and `.domain-badge`.
- **Entity modal wrong metadata**: `openEntityModal` always appended ATT&CK metadata summary (Score, CVE, Hyperlinks, Observables) even for STIX items. Now shows STIX spec properties via `buildStixPropertySummary()` for custom type items.
- **STIX properties lost on import**: `sanitizeImportedData()` `customLibrary` sanitizer only kept 8 core fields, discarding all STIX-specific properties. Now imports all spec-defined fields with type-appropriate sanitization.

### Security
- STIX bundle import validates: file size (25 MB max), bundle structure (`type: "bundle"`, `objects` array), object count (5000 max), STIX ID format, type prefix matching, type whitelist.
- All imported STIX strings sanitized via `sanitizeImportedString()` — strips control chars, `<script>` tags, event handlers, angle brackets, SQL comment sequences.
- All imported STIX strings pass through `stripAngleBracketsFromJson()` on the raw JSON parse.
- Boolean, integer, list, and string fields handled separately with type-appropriate validation.
- List fields bounded to 100 items max.

## [2.6.0] - 2026-02-08

### Added
- **Custom STIX Objects**: New fourth sidebar tab "Custom" for creating, browsing, and managing user-defined STIX 2.1 objects.
- All 18 STIX Domain Objects supported: attack-pattern, campaign, course-of-action, grouping, identity, indicator, infrastructure, intrusion-set, location, malware, malware-analysis, note, observed-data, opinion, report, threat-actor, tool, vulnerability — plus free-form `x-custom` type.
- Create modal with STIX type picker, name, description, labels, and optional custom type name for `x-custom`.
- Custom items are draggable to kill chain phases and groups alongside ATT&CK/CAPEC/CWE entities.

- Embedded STIX bundle in JSON export when custom items are present.
- Relationship SROs auto-generated for co-located custom items in the same phase/group, using `STIX_RELATIONSHIP_MAP` for semantically accurate relationship types.
- CSV export includes custom STIX items with `STIX: {type}` in the Type column.
- Import validation accepts `customItems[]` arrays, `customLibrary` object, STIX ID format validation (`{type}--{uuid}`), and type whitelist enforcement.
- `TYPE_KEYS` / `TAG_CLASSES` / `TYPE_LABELS` / `ALL_ENTITY_TYPES` lookup constants replacing ~10 hardcoded ternary chains, enabling future entity types.
- `STIX_ID_PATTERN` regex, `VALID_STIX_TYPES` set, `STIX_RELATIONSHIP_MAP` for secure validation.
- `generateUUID()` and `generateStixId()` utility functions.
- `STIX.md` implementation plan document.
- `CONFIG.stixTypes` array with all 19 STIX type definitions.
- `CONFIG.display.maxCustomLabels`, `maxLabelLength`, `maxCustomDescLength` limits.
- `CONFIG.frameworks.custom` teal color (`#14b8a6`) with CSS variable.

### Changed
- `renderKillChain()` layout rendering refactored from 3 separate type if-blocks to unified `state.layers[type]` + `getEntityName()` lookup.
- Group item rendering similarly unified to support all four entity types.
- `renderAll()` now includes `filterEntities('custom')`.
- `ensureAssignmentShape()` processes `customItems` arrays.
- `ensureLibraryFallbacks()` creates stub entries for orphaned custom item IDs.
- `sanitizeImportedData()` accepts `customItems`, `customLibrary`, and `custom` in layers/activeTab whitelists.
- Explore button hidden for custom items (not supported in Relationship Explorer).
- Compact mode CSS selectors extended to include `.custom-tag`.
- Import/export round-trips preserve full custom item state.

### Security
- Custom item names sanitized via `InputSecurity.sanitize()` with length cap.
- STIX IDs validated against strict regex pattern before import.
- STIX types validated against `VALID_STIX_TYPES` whitelist (no arbitrary type strings).
- Labels array bounded by `maxCustomLabels` with per-label sanitization.
- Description length bounded by `maxCustomDescLength`.
- All custom item rendering uses `InputSecurity.escapeHtml()`.
- Import path uses separate `sanitizeImportedCustomAssignment()` function with STIX-specific validation.
- CSV export applies formula injection protection to custom item fields.

## [2.5.3] - 2026-02-07

### Added
- CWE `ALL.xml` full list as a third CWE source alongside HARDWARE.xml and SOFTWARE.xml.
- Editable kill chain title displayed centered in the content-header bar above the stats.
- Title persists through JSON export/import round-trips and appears in CSV export as a metadata row.
- Title sanitized via `sanitizeForStorage()` and capped at 200 characters (`CONFIG.display.maxTitleLength`).
- Export filenames derived from the title when set (e.g. `My-Analysis.json`).
- Compact-mode variant with smaller title font.
- Improved CWE coverage by parsing the complete CWE catalogue, capturing weaknesses not present in the hardware/software-only views.

### Changed
- `extract-data.py` now reads CWE/ALL.xml in addition to HARDWARE.xml and SOFTWARE.xml, with deduplication across all three sources.
- `config.js` includes `sources.cwe.all` path for the full CWE list.
- Navigator import now **replaces** the ATT&CK technique library instead of merging, preventing stale techniques from accumulating across imports.
- Three domain buttons (Enterprise/Mobile/ICS) replaced with a single "Import Navigator" file picker in the ATT&CK sidebar tab.
- Relationship mappings (`techniqueToCapec`, `capecToTechnique`, `cweToCapec`) and CAPEC/CWE libraries are preserved across Navigator imports so the Explorer remains fully functional.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-01-29

### Added - Unified Attack Chain Editor

Major update renaming `demo-editor.html` to `index.html` as the main application.

#### Centralized Configuration
- **New file**: `config.js` - Centralized color and settings configuration
  - Phase colors: IN (#10b981 emerald), THROUGH (#06b6d4 cyan), OUT (#ef4444 red)
  - Framework colors: ATT&CK (blue), CAPEC (purple), CWE (orange)
  - UI colors and display settings
  - `applyConfigColors()` function for runtime updates

#### UI/UX Polish
- **Export Dropdown** - JSON and CSV buttons consolidated into dropdown menu
- **Version Badge** - Clickable version link (v2.3.0) opens CHANGELOG.md
- **Usage Guide Modal** - Built-in help with 6 sections:
  - Getting Started, Drag & Drop, Kill Chain Phases
  - Filters & Views, Export Options, Tips
  - Opens via `?` help icon or programmatically
  - Closes on Escape key or click outside
- **Fixed Close Button** - Detail panel header uses flexbox, no more overlap
- **Brighter Phase Colors** - Distinct colors for IN/THROUGH/OUT (not framework colors)

#### ATT&CK STIX Bundle Parsing
- **New script**: `scripts/extract-attack.py` - Parses ATT&CK v18.1 STIX bundles
  - Extracts 898 techniques across Enterprise (691), Mobile (124), ICS (83)
  - Resolves 1,943 mitigation relationships
  - Links 522 sub-techniques to parent techniques
  - Outputs `resources/attack-techniques.json` with full metadata

- **New data file**: `resources/attack-techniques.json`
  - Complete technique library with: id, name, description, platforms, tactics
  - Sub-technique info with parent technique links
  - Mitigations (id, name, description) per technique
  - Detection guidance and external references
  - Version info from STIX bundles

#### Drag and Drop Support
- **Drag entities from sidebar** to kill chain phases
- All entity types supported: ATT&CK techniques, CAPECs, CWEs
- Visual feedback: items dim while dragging, phases highlight as drop targets
- Grab cursor on draggable items
- Auto-reassignment: dropping on new phase moves entity from previous phase
- Toast notifications confirm assignments

#### Enhanced Entity Display
- **Sidebar entity list improvements**:
  - ATT&CK: Shows ↳ indicator for sub-techniques, first tactic badge, platforms
  - Description preview tooltip on hover
  
- **Kill chain phase tags now show names**:
  - All three types (ATT&CK, CAPEC, CWE) display ID + name
  - Consistent max-width (200px) with ellipsis truncation
  - Prevents layout overflow for long names

#### Detail Panel Enhancements
- **ATT&CK technique details** when clicked:
  - Full description (truncated to 800 chars)
  - Attributes table: Domain, Platforms, Tactics, Parent technique, Version
  - Detection information (when available)
  - Mitigations list (up to 8) with tooltip descriptions
  - Related CAPECs from mappings
  - External references (up to 3)
  - Direct link to MITRE ATT&CK page

#### UI/UX Improvements
- All layers (ATT&CK, CAPEC, CWE) now visible by default
- Layer checkboxes properly synced with initial state
- `getTechniqueName()` now uses loaded technique library first
- Navigator import shows count of existing vs new techniques

### Technical Context for Agents

#### File Rename
- `demo-editor.html` → `index.html` (now main application entry point)

#### New Files
```
config.js                         # Centralized configuration (colors, version, settings)
scripts/extract-attack.py         # STIX parser, run to regenerate technique data
resources/attack-techniques.json  # 898 techniques with full metadata
```

#### Configuration System
```javascript
// config.js structure
const CONFIG = {
    version: '2.3.0',
    phases: { in: '#10b981', through: '#06b6d4', out: '#ef4444' },
    frameworks: { attack: '#3b82f6', capec: '#8b5cf6', cwe: '#f59e0b' },
    ui: { ... },
    display: { maxTagWidth: '200px', ... }
};
```

#### STIX Bundle Processing
- Reads: `resources/enterprise-attack-18.1.json`, `mobile-attack-18.1.json`, `ics-attack-18.1.json`
- Single-pass extraction for efficiency
- Relationship resolution maps mitigation and parent technique IDs to data

#### Drag & Drop Implementation
```javascript
// Global drag state
let dragData = { type: null, id: null };

// Key functions
handleDragStart(event, type, id)  // Sets drag data, adds visual feedback
handleDragEnd(event)              // Cleans up drag state
handleDragOver(event)             // Enables drop, highlights target
handleDragLeave(event)            // Removes highlight
handleDrop(event, phaseKey)       // Performs assignment
```

#### Entity Item Attributes
```html
<div class="entity-item attack" 
     draggable="true"
     ondragstart="handleDragStart(event, 'attack', 'T1566')"
     ondragend="handleDragEnd(event)">
```

#### Phase Drop Handlers
```html
<div class="phase" data-phase="IN:reconnaissance"
     ondragover="handleDragOver(event)"
     ondragleave="handleDragLeave(event)"
     ondrop="handleDrop(event, 'IN:reconnaissance')">
```

## Development Notes

### File Structure Understanding
```
index.html                 - Standalone visualizer with sample data
demo.html                  - Interactive demo, scenario presets
demo-advanced.html         - Advanced mode with manual mapping
resources/*.json           - Navigator layer files for import
```

### Key Data Structures

**Technique Input Format:**
```javascript
{ "T1566": "Phishing", "T1059": "Command and Scripting Interpreter" }
```

**Navigator Layer Format:**
```javascript
{
  "techniques": [
    { "techniqueID": "T1566", "tactic": "initial-access", "enabled": true }
  ]
}
```

**Kill Chain Structure:**
```javascript
this.killChainStructure = {
  'IN': { name: '...', phases: [{ id, name, techniquePatterns: [...] }] },
  'THROUGH': { ... },
  'OUT': { ... }
}
```

### Common Modification Points
1. **Add new phase**: Update `killChainStructure` in constructor
2. **Add technique mappings**: Update `techniquePatterns` arrays
3. **Change styling**: Modify CSS in HTML files and `applyColors()`
4. **Add new domain**: Update `detectDomain()`, `guessPhaseFromId()`, `getMitreAttackUrl()`

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] All three domains display correctly
- [ ] Navigator layer import works
- [ ] Manual mappings persist correctly
- [ ] Technique links open correct URLs
- [ ] Compact mode toggles properly
- [ ] Statistics update on technique changes
